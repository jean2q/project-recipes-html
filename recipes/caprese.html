    <p>The traditional Italian caprese salad (pronounced “cah-preh-zseh”) is typically made with just tomatoes, basil, mozzarella and olive oil but I love the addition of a balsamic reduction. It adds so much flavor!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Fresh mozzarella: I like to buy the pre-sliced to make things go faster, just make sure it’s sliced about the thickness we are looking for here. Of course you can buy it whole and slice on your own – the taste isn’t any different either way.</li>
        <li>Extra virgin olive oil: Don’t use standard refined olive oil, it should include the words “extra virgin.” This type of olive oil is less processed and has more flavor.</li>
        <li>Fresh tomatoes: I like to use vine ripened tomatoes from the store, or of course garden grown tomatoes are the best.</li>
        <li>Fresh basil: Avoid any basil that is dark and bruised. Look for vibrantly green leaves that aren’t wilting.</li>
        <li>Balsamic vinegar: No need for crazy expensive balsamic vinegar here but do use something decent with a well balanced flavor.</li>
        <li>Honey: This ingredient is optional and you can just add it based on how tart/sweet the balsamic vinegar you use is.</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper: Add this to taste to bring out, and compliment the flavors of the dish.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Make balsamic reduction: Whisk together balsamic vinegar and honey in a small saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium heat then reduce heat to low and let simmer until thickened and reduced down to nearly 2 Tbsp, about 8 – 11 minutes.</li>
        <li>Let it cool: Pour into small bowl and let cool to room temperature, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Assemble salad: Layer tomato slices, fresh mozzarella and basil on a rimmed serving platter.</li>
        <li>Dress and serve: Drizzle with olive oil, balsamic glaze and season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
